This report outlines the major existing techniques for the simulation of granular materials, such as sand, snow, sugar, powder, ...  It will give a short overview of the physics that these materials obey, which are quite particular. After reviewing the physics, it explains the different ways these materials and their physics are simulated in the computer graphics community, including the interaction between granular material and other materials. While there is a long history of researching and simulating granular matter in physics and engineering, the scope of this report is limited to techniques used in the computer graphics and visual effects community, which has specific demands for its techniques. The report concludes with an overview of the implementation of one of the techniques the author made.
