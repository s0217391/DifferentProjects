\section{Conclusion}
In this report, the student presented all the algorithms he implemented to simulate the behaviour of cloth. An overview:
\begin{itemize}
\item a particle-based model of cloth, with springs for the internal forces. The software can turn any triangular mesh into the chosen model. Section \ref{sec_model}.
\item Three different integration schemes, including a full implicit one. Section \ref{sec_integrate}.
\item Some basic collision handling for believability, based on \cite{position_based_dyn}. Section \ref{sec_collision}.
\item A tearing technique, based on earlier work but complemented with a novel data structure that served better for the given purpose. Section \ref{sec_tear}.
\end{itemize}
These algorithms were implemented and encapsulated in a library, as explained in section \ref{sec_software}. In order to demonstrate the library a graphical interface was built using QT and OpenGl, interacting directly with said library.
